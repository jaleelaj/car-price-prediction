Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Car Price Prediction

This repository contains a simple implementation of car price prediction using linear regression. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. In this project, we will use linear regression to predict the price of cars based on various features such as mileage, age, brand, etc.

Introduction
Car price prediction is a common problem in the automotive industry, as well as in the field of data science and machine learning. By utilizing historical data and features associated with cars, we can build a linear regression model that learns to predict car prices accurately.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various cars, including their mileage, age, brand, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is stored in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file named car_data.csv.
Model Training
The linear regression model is trained using the features from the dataset. The training process involves finding the best-fitting line that minimizes the difference between the predicted prices and the actual prices.

Evaluation
The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts car prices based on the given features.

Future Improvements
This project is a basic implementation of car price prediction using linear regression. There are several ways to improve upon this project, such as:

Exploring more advanced regression techniques.
Handling missing data and outliers.
Feature engineering to create new relevant features.
Visualizing the results and model performance.
